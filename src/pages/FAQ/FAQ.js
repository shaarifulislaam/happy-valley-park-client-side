                  Crawl, walk, run, swim. That’s the order a parent ⏤ whether a
                  proficient lap swimmer or one still deathly afraid of the
                  water ⏤ should think about their child’s physical milestones.
                  Few life skills are as important as the ability to survive in
                  the water.

                  Imagine teaching in front of a sea of children, desks stacked
                  so closely together you have to creatively maneuver yourself
                  to move about the classroom. With an abundance of students,
                  it's difficult to find the capacity or time to truly focus on
                  each individual's strengths and weaknesses, tailor teaching
                  according to their needs, or know how to push each one
                  uniquely toward success.

                  The best age for your child to begin the process of learning
                  to swim is as close to 6mo as possible. The sooner your child
                  begins to learn to swim, the sooner they will learn be safe in
                  the water.

                  Kids do better in school when parents are involved in their
                  academic lives. Attending back-to-school night at the start of
                  the school year is a great way to get to know your child's
                  teachers and their expectations. School administrators may
                  discuss school-wide programs and policies, too.
